Change log
==========

v2023.04.16
-----------
* Bug fix: in Vim, when using the Cscope bridge functionality to jump to
  results, the results provided by Clink now always have their line content
  included (commit d66752359f3241b0bd9c7bf68dd6b77936b45a55).
* Bug fix: query text remains visible when returning from Vim (commit
  29ece0d347351f2e6709d15b9757ceb3ecb14aeb).
* Bug fix: Database pragmas are now enforced correctly. This could have
  previously resulted in performance degradation (commit
  51e7e6ca34898f39c8e0e2fbb7f7efa1fe220f8d).
* API break: ``clink_db_add_record`` gained an output parameter for record
  identifier. This can be used as an opaque reference to optimise later
  Cscope-based parsing through ``clink_parse_with_cscope`` which gained a new
  parameter (commits 5b3e991878c22bdc38bf0348e9f5dd126a4afd14,
  471f95fba82fcc952236026a90ce8bf43b64d8d1).
* Database files are now versioned. Attempting to open a database generated by a
  different incompatible version of Clink will be rejected. When upgrading
  through a change that alters the database version, existing databases will
  need to be regenerated (commits 2e1c518b74fa85aa8c74f18c825ea5a2cb610da1,
  12b35720f4e6f4b032d8e2645be20ce437139c18,
  5d387af62de20e5597f5133c6174e5108a100aab,
  73adbb1aef1b6637926b30f36463a386c74a3fd2).
* Database creation is up to 77% faster. Database files are up to 65% smaller
  (commits 66c5ea825b33e050ead9d95f692e0e5649f5af0d,
  5b3e991878c22bdc38bf0348e9f5dd126a4afd14,

v2023.03.31
-----------
* Bug fix: syntax highlighted results in the UI are no longer affected by the
  highlighting of your last search term in Vim (commit
  642817e2b3fb3af2a0bfb02dfd07cea8e5bf9a7a).
* Database construction when using Cscope for parsing is ~16% faster (commits
  12e8e3113855a98cf9dd32bd2c6ca4688ca2f4fa,
  15d4bcc6b80b832c3b5192b7b6f015337e3705c2).

v2023.01.30
-----------
* Bug fix: pressing space in the UI view no longer advances too many entries
  (commit 3fe36b8f81ce4f78386ef4252bbef852ee26e9b6).
* Calls to the ``__atomic`` built-ins are now correctly detected when parsing in
  Clang mode (commit ff9dfb76daad6f43bb3dcbf8f612a75c1e9b05e9).
* Calls to the ``__sync`` built-ins are now correctly detected when parsing in
  Clang mode (commit 5a03a46542eaf1a4e54603c53d1caf370ac76f84).
* On-demand syntax highlighting that occurs in the UI now uses multiple threads
  (commit 45404b1844df0a13a7343b0b8c4aef2dac2fa67e).

v2023.01.01
-----------
* Bug fix: mouse pasting and middle-click pasting into the UI works once again
  (commit 17ea019394edf56baba8de784efd6dc8f0a28cd2).
* The ``\r`` and ``\n`` characters are no longer permitted in comment delimiters
  when describing a language to parse with the generic parser (commit
  a9f8a5974cb42d5f5cf968720fbf69b0e3059e0e).

v2022.12.27
-----------
* A new option, ``--script``, for automating Clink has been added. See the man
  page for details (commit 69b4a46ca6a3fb0431851a3b7d4bc7cfd7f9b4fb).
* libclink gained functions for using transactions on the underlying SQLite
  database (commit 91e296ca959d2e383ef89058891a8d3d05a8663a).
* Several performance improvements have made both indexing and searching faster
  (commits 7196725910c2bba3c1fe69a9bad58993b6a36dc5,
  b50bf2b1b85abb31843ae63432c796e92c4b3fed,
  ce07dd445992855872c679f44a1ce43910f53356,
  5de623d08b05ab61a5e39d83b5bbab87a94e443b).

v2022.12.04
-----------
* Bug fix: the ``--parse-cxx=clang`` command line option correctly sets the C++
  parsing mode instead of mistakenly setting the C parsing mode.
* ``--parse-c`` and ``--parse-cxx`` gained a new option that is also the new
  default, ``auto``. In this mode, ``clang`` is selected if a
  compile_commands.json is found or Cscope is not installed. Otherwise
  ``cscope`` is selected (commits a2a50c6f314fc9035694b7e0110dc8897c1d46c3,
  3fec779f6a9a18daa3a2661abc204704fe29ab8b,
  6d4275cca3c01040804dafeee79b2efb927e5ace).
* The file content lines stored in the database are now restricted to only those
  containing referenced symbols. The only user-visible effect for ``clink``
  users should be reduced on-disk database size and improved runtime (commit
  a14aeda4b6fb0f5422fc648efb144bad289d8bde).

v2022.10.29
-----------
* Bug fix: it is no longer possible to navigate off the bottom of the result
  list or select results on the next page (commit series merged in
  09cfbd140582d7d5b89163ce5d3adac6034affeb).
* Bug fix: Vim returning a non-zero exit status no longer causes Clink to exit
  or crash (commit series merged in b17e61fe61c02753c6876a3999d36c52a4ce2709).
* The selected row in the result list is now highlighted in blue. This behaviour
  is controllable with the ``--colour`` command line option (commit
  7d76f3a52a917b1f5dfbf78210dc6928338e7fcb).
* Paths in the result list are shown relative to the current directory instead
  of absolute (commit 83300fe55acb2cba5690a3c337a7dac3c8430178).
* Text animations can now be disabled through the ``--animation`` command line
  option. See ``--help`` for more information (commit series merged in
  85e52cd4ee1639f58e2ea8c446a2c109ff935f57).
* LLVM 15 is now supported in the build system (commit series merged in
  60fedb806aded6b10973ee618bc122e6b3712a69).

v2022.10.22
-----------
* ``clink`` can now locate a ``clink-repl`` adjacent to itself and pass this to
  Vim instead of assuming ``clink-repl`` can be found through ``$PATH``. This
  means the location you install Clink to no longer needs to be added to
  ``$PATH`` to avoid errors when ``clink`` opens Vim (commit series merged in
  afdfddca57885c363e518a4923d28f7024124a9e).
* Vim is checked for on startup and an error is shown, rather than trying to run
  Vim later and failing confusingly if it is not installed (commit
  7ac2d7c24ec933e67d29011ef122dcb94dddbb2c).
* Filenames beginning with characters like ``-`` no longer cause problems when
  opening Vim (commit 4375fa9c1fe02c861a7655f584e54854c7e4d393).

v2022.10.15
-----------
* The ``--parse-c`` and ``--parse-cxx`` options gained a new possible argument,
  ``cscope`` that uses Cscope to parse sources. This can be useful in a foreign
  project whose build flags you do not know and thus libclang struggles to parse
  accurately (commits merged in 874a2b894e91e227e9a94007f3ec08c42d289d71).
* Exit status from ``clink`` now follows sysexits.h guidelines more closely
  (commit 4c16e47b7a1c42f46615fbba67f0c1def4225a10).

v2022.09.24
-----------
* The generic C, C++, MSVC DEF, and Python parsers now all recognise comment
  syntax (commits 8a80c768808f616c205b5fb39f1b4176bcf66dc4,
  0d7d0b2e7c46e898a90f4eda569f515c0997f8b3,
  e8b71beecb0fe2061cc5195c6ed7556696fe5a5a,
  a01295e13bac6d944ec0532be6e1bee578ef292c).
* The generic C and C++ parsers now recognise string and character literals
  (commits 8f5748f431edaa1bc26ebd1f349702af5ada020f,
  2b3aeff124c5084065416d39519936da4434fa78).
* The language struct passed to ``clink_parse_generic`` has a slightly different
  format (commit 71c2deb12ae6f4bc8be12fde1f696a136f9346f1).
* ``clink_parse_generic`` supports recognising comment syntax (commit
  8898445c3a5afa9e0bea72233240c9c92d367c20).
* The callback to ``clink_vim_read`` now receives a non-const string (commit
  244c295ade59d3d4a188f64cec9c70b7aa690b6e).
* White space in file content lines is left-trimmed before insertion into the
  database (commit dbc8aaa59e06de1f6fb2630c0abb16a35a33c456).

v2022.09.18
-----------
* Initial release.
