.TH CLINK 1
.SH NAME
clink \- C/C++/assembly code navigator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B \fBclink\fR \fIoptions...\fR [\fIpaths...\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Clink is a replacement for Cscope that uses libclang, features syntax
highlighting, multicore support, and more.
.SH OPTIONS
\fB--build-only\fR, \fB-b\fR
.RS
Exit after constructing or updating the symbol database. That is, do not load a
user interface.
.RE
.PP
\fB--colour\fR \fIwhen\fR, \fB--color\fR \fIwhen\fR
.RS
Enable or disable the use of ANSI colour codes. Possible values of \fIwhen\fR
are "always" (enable), "never" (disable), and "auto" (decide based on whether
stdout is a TTY).
.RE
.PP
\fB--database\fR \fIFILE\fR, \fB-f\fR \fIFILE\fR
.RS
Open or create the symbol database at path \fIFILE\fR. Without this option,
Clink will default to opening the file .clink.db in the current directory or any
parent thereof if it exists. It will stop its search when it reaches the root of
a Git, Mercurial, or Subversion checkout, under the assumption that you do not
wish to index beyond the boundary of a repository you are in.
.PP
If no repository root is found, the search will stop when reaching the root
directory of the file system, at which point Clink will fallback to .clink.db in
the current directory.
.RE
.PP
\fB--debug\fR
.RS
Enable Clink debugging mode. This is intended for debugging problems within
Clink itself.
.RE
.PP
\fB--help\fR, \fB-h\fR
.RS
Display this help information.
.RE
.PP
\fB--jobs\fR \fINUM\fR, \fB-j\fR \fINUM\fR
.RS
Use the given number of threads when performing multithreaded operations. You
can also pass the special value "auto" (the default) which uses the number of
processors in your system.
.RE
.PP
\fB-l\fR
.RS
Use the line-oriented interface instead of the NCurses-based interface. The
line-oriented interface mimics Cscope's behavior just enough to feed Vim the
information it needs. It is missing all other functions and is not intended for
interactive use by a human.
.RE
.PP
\fB--no-build\fR, \fB-d\fR
.RS
Do not update the database.
.RE
.PP
\fB--version\fR, \fB-V\fR
.RS
Print the current version and exit.
